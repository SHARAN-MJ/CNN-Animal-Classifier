# CNN-Animal-Classifier

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`cnn.ipynb`) demonstrating a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with PyTorch to classify images into three categories: **cats**, **dogs**, and **pandas**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and train a CNN that can accurately distinguish between cats, dogs, and pandas.  
The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing image data using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` and transforms.
- Building a custom CNN architecture using `torch.nn.Module`.
- Training the model and tracking performance over epochs.
- Evaluating the model with **loss & accuracy plots** and a **confusion matrix**.

This project is beginner-friendly yet covers all the important steps of building an image classifier in PyTorch.

## Dataset

The dataset should be structured like this:

> ðŸ“Œ **Important:**  
> The notebook assumes the dataset path is `/content/drive/My Drive/dataset/Project` (for Google Colab).  
> If you use a different environment or local machine, change the `root` variable in `cnn.ipynb` to your dataset path (e.g., `./dataset/Project`).

## Model Architecture

The custom CNN (`CNN` class) includes:
- Two convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d`) each followed by ReLU activation and max pooling (`nn.MaxPool2d`).
- First conv layer: 16 output channels, second conv layer: 32 output channels.
- A fully connected layer (`nn.Linear`) reducing features to 128.
- Final output layer mapping 128 features to 3 classes.

Input images are resized to **224Ã—224**. After the conv and pooling layers, the flattened feature size becomes `32 * 56 * 56`, which is passed to the fully connected layers.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset as described in the [## Dataset](#dataset) section.

2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook cnn.ipynb

3. Run each cell step by step:

Mount Google Drive (if using Colab)

Import libraries and define transforms

Load data

Build and train the model

Visualize training results
